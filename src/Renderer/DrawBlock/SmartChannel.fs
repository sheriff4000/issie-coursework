(* 
    HLP23: This module will normally be used exclusively by team member doing the "smart channel route" 
    part of the individual coding. During group phase work how it is used is up to the
    group. Functions from other members MUST be documented by "HLP23: AUTHOR" XML 
    comment as in SmartHelpers.

    Normally it will update multiple wires in the BusWire model so could use the SmartHelper function for
    this purpose.
