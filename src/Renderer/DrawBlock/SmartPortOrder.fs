(* 
    HLP23: This module will normally be used exclusively by team member doing the "smart port reorder" 
    part of the individual coding. During group phase work how it is used is up to the
    group. Functions from other members MUST be documented by "HLP23: AUTHOR" XML 
    comment as in SmartHelpers.

    Normally it will update multiple wires and symbols in the BusWire model so could use the SmartHelper 
    functions for this purpose.

/// To test this, it must be given two symbols interconnected by wires. It then reorders the ports on
/// symbolToOrder so that the connecting wires do not cross.
/// Tt should work out the interconnecting wires (wiresToOrder) from 
////the two symbols, wModel.Wires and sModel.Ports
/// It will do nothing if symbolToOrder is not a Custom component (which has re-orderable ports).
let reOrderPorts 
    (wModel: BusWireT.Model) 
    (symbolToOrder: Symbol) 
    (otherSymbol: Symbol) 
        : BusWireT.Model =
    printfn $"ReorderPorts: ToOrder:{symbolToOrder.Component.Label}, Other:{otherSymbol.Component.Label}"
    let sModel = wModel.Symbol
    
    printfn $"Wire List:{(SmartHelpers.allWires wModel).Length}"
    
    printfn $"Connected wires: {SmartHelpers.connectingWires symbolToOrder otherSymbol wModel}"
    
    
    let wiresToOrder = [] // replace this with correct wires
    
    let symbol' = symbolToOrder // no change at the moment
    // HLP23: This could be cleaned up using Optics - see SmartHelpers for examples
    {wModel with 
        Wires = wModel.Wires // no change for now, but probably this function should use update wires after reordering.
                             // to make that happen the tyest function which calls this would need to provide an updateWire
                             // function to this as a parameter (as was done in Tick3)
        Symbol = {sModel with Symbols = Map.add symbol'.Id symbol' sModel.Symbols}
